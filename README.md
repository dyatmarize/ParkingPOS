# ParkingPOS
Parking Point of Sales System
Technical Test for PT. Inovasi Anak Indonesia (Parkee)

#How-To Build
1. Create a database and import the included sql file in this repositories (parkingpos.sql)
2. Run the .exe file, and the input for username and password is "user", "user1234".

#Note
1. If you can't login from the .exe file or while running the project from IDE, I think its because the root and password configuration in JdbcDataObj.java, 
  I haven't found the solution yet, because it's my first try to make a desktop application.
